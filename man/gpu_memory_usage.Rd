\title{Estimate GPU memory usage of a tbl_gpu object}
\usage{
gpu_memory_usage(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{tbl_gpu} object.}
}
\value{
The estimated memory usage in bytes (numeric), or \code{NA} if the
object is not a valid \code{tbl_gpu} or has no data on GPU.
}
\description{
Calculates the estimated GPU memory footprint of a GPU table based on
its dimensions and column types. This is useful for understanding memory
requirements before working with large datasets.
}
\details{
The estimate includes:
\itemize{
\item Column data (varies by type: 8 bytes for FLOAT64, 4 bytes for INT32, etc.)
\item Validity bitmasks for NA handling (1 bit per row per column)
}

String columns use an average estimate of 32 bytes per element, which may
vary significantly based on actual string lengths.

This is an estimate and actual GPU memory usage may be higher due to:
\itemize{
\item Memory alignment requirements
\item RMM memory pool overhead
\item Temporary allocations
}
}
\examples{
if (has_gpu()) {
  gpu_mtcars <- tbl_gpu(mtcars)
  size <- gpu_memory_usage(gpu_mtcars)
  cat("Estimated GPU memory:", round(size / 1024, 1), "KB\n")
}
}
