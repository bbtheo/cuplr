\title{Filter rows of a GPU table}
\usage{
\method{filter}{tbl_gpu}(.data, ..., .preserve = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A \code{tbl_gpu} object created by \code{\link[=tbl_gpu]{tbl_gpu()}}.}

\item{...}{Logical expressions to filter by. Each expression should be
a comparison of the form \verb{column <op> value} or \verb{column <op> column}.
Multiple conditions are combined with AND (all must be TRUE).}

\item{.preserve}{Ignored. Included for compatibility with dplyr generic.}
}
\value{
A \code{tbl_gpu} object containing only rows where all conditions are TRUE.
The GPU memory for the filtered result is newly allocated.
}
\description{
Selects rows from a GPU table where conditions are TRUE, similar to
\code{dplyr::filter()}. Filtering is performed entirely on the GPU for
maximum performance on large datasets.
}
\details{
\subsection{Supported comparison operators}{

\itemize{
\item \code{==} - equal to
\item \code{!=} - not equal to
\item \code{>} - greater than
\item \code{>=} - greater than or equal to
\item \code{<} - less than
\item \code{<=} - less than or equal to
}
}

\subsection{Current limitations}{

\itemize{
\item Only simple comparisons are supported (column op value/column)
\item Compound expressions with \code{&} or \code{|} are not yet supported
\item String comparisons are not yet implemented
\item Only numeric scalar values on the right-hand side
}
}

\subsection{Performance}{

Filtering on GPU is highly parallel and can process billions of rows
per second. For best performance, chain multiple filter conditions
rather than using compound expressions.

\examples{
if (has_gpu()) {
  gpu_mtcars <- tbl_gpu(mtcars)

  # Filter with single condition
  efficient_cars <- gpu_mtcars |>
    filter(mpg > 25)

  # Multiple conditions (combined with AND)
  result <- gpu_mtcars |>
    filter(mpg > 20) |>
    filter(cyl == 4) |>
    collect()

  # Compare two columns
  gpu_cars <- tbl_gpu(cars)
  fast_stops <- gpu_cars |>
    filter(dist < speed) |>
    collect()
}
